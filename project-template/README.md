# Project template for sqxclib

This directory contain files and directories that used to create sqxclib project.  
You must install sqxclib headers and libraries in system before you use these files.

## Install sqxclib

You can use CMake or meson to build and install sqxclib.  
If you get error while loading shared libraries, you may need setup LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  
  
For example: sqxclib shared libraries installed in /usr/local/lib

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Create project
1. create project directory.
2. copy all files from this directory to project directory.
3. use CMake or meson to build project.

## Project Directories

#### /sqxcapp
This directory contain sqxctool and static libraries 'sqxcapp-user', 'sqxcapptool-user'.

#### /database/migrations
This directory contain C or C++ migration files that generated by sqxctool (or sqxcpptool).  
CMake or meson will compile these migration files into static libraries 'sqxcapp-user' and 'sqxcapptool-user'.

#### /src
This directory contain 4 kinds of executable target:

1. ***main.c***  use 'sqxc' shared library only.
2. ***main-cxx.cpp***  is the same as ***main.c*** but use C++ language.
3. ***main-sqxcapp.c***  use 'sqxc' and 'sqxcapp' shared libraries with sqxctool.
4. ***main-sqxcapp-cxx.cpp***  is the same as ***main-sqxcapp.c*** but use C++ language.
